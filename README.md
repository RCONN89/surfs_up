## Overview
  To find out how well a potential icecream shop will do in Oahu yearround Mr. Avy wanted to see data for the months of June and December.
## Results
The results from the data are listed below.
  1. Oahu's average temperature in June is 74.9 degrees Fahrenheit and 71.0 degrees Fahrenheit in December.
  2. In June, Oahu has a high of 85 degrees and a low of 64 degrees.
  3. In Decemeber, Oahu has a high of 83 degrees and a low of 56 degrees.
    
## Summary
  Although the data is showing better potential for icecream sales in June than December, I think Mr. Avy will be happy to see that the weather in December will
also be good for selling icecream. The coldest it gets in either month is 56 degrees and the averages temps for June and December are 74.9 and 71.0 degrees
respectively. I also created another table to see if rain would be disruptive to sales in June and December, but, with precipitation averaging less than 0.2in in June 
and less than 0.3in in December, I think it's safe to say that rain won't be a barrier to good profits in Oahu.
